# Process

Built-in functions for the current process & child processes

### Example usage

```lua
local process = require("@lune/process")

-- Getting the arguments passed to the Lune script
for index, arg in process.args do
    print("Process argument #" .. tostring(index) .. ": " .. arg)
end

-- Getting the currently available environment variables
local PORT: string? = process.env.PORT
local HOME: string? = process.env.HOME
for name, value in process.env do
    print("Environment variable " .. name .. " is set to " .. value)
end

-- Getting the current os and processor architecture
print("Running " .. process.os .. " on " .. process.arch .. "!")

-- Spawning a child process
local result = process.spawn("program", {
    "cli argument",
    "other cli argument"
})
if result.ok then
    print(result.stdout)
else
    print(result.stderr)
end
```

## Properties

### arch

The architecture of the processor currently being used.

Possible values:

* `"x86_64"`
* `"aarch64"`

### cwd

The current working directory in which the Lune script is running.

### os

The current operating system being used.

Possible values:

* `"linux"`
* `"macos"`
* `"windows"`

## Functions

### exit

```lua
function Process.exit(code: number?)
```

Exits the currently running script as soon as possible with the given exit code.

Exit code 0 is treated as a successful exit, any other value is treated as an error.

Setting the exit code using this function will override any otherwise automatic exit code.

### spawn

```lua
function Process.spawn(program: string, params: { string }?, options: SpawnOptions?)
```

Spawns a child process that will run the program `program`, and returns a dictionary that describes the final status and ouput of the child process.

The second argument, `params`, can be passed as a list of string parameters to give to the program.

The third argument, `options`, can be passed as a dictionary of options to give to the child process.
Refer to the documentation for `SpawnOptions` for specific option keys and their values.

## Types

### Arch

```lua
type Arch = "x86_64" | "aarch64"
```

### OS

```lua
type OS = "linux" | "macos" | "windows"
```

### SpawnOptions

```lua
type SpawnOptions = {
	cwd: string?,
	env: { [string]: string }?,
	shell: (boolean | string)?,
	stdio: SpawnOptionsStdio?,
}
```

A dictionary of options for `process.spawn`, with the following available values:

* `cwd` - The current working directory for the process
* `env` - Extra environment variables to give to the process
* `shell` - Whether to run in a shell or not - set to `true` to run using the default shell, or a string to run using a specific shell
* `stdio` - How to treat output and error streams from the child process - set to "inherit" to pass output and error streams to the current process

### SpawnOptionsStdio

```lua
type SpawnOptionsStdio = "inherit" | "default"
```

### SpawnResult

```lua
type SpawnResult = {
	ok: boolean,
	code: number,
	stdout: string,
	stderr: string,
}
```

Result type for child processes in `process.spawn`.

This is a dictionary containing the following values:

* `ok` - If the child process exited successfully or not, meaning the exit code was zero or not set
* `code` - The exit code set by the child process, or 0 if one was not set
* `stdout` - The full contents written to stdout by the child process, or an empty string if nothing was written
* `stderr` - The full contents written to stderr by the child process, or an empty string if nothing was written
